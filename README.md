# JS_Projects_FreeCodeCamp

Hello folks, It is Nurillo.
I am going to share my solutions to the Javascript projects that I find interesting over the course of FreeCodeCamp.
The purpose of the projects for mostly beginners, and it can teach you how basic and simple JS projects look like. In the first project of all five, I addressed a problem in how Polindrome Checker works. Second, Roman numeral Converter. The other projects: Ceather Ciphers, Telepehone number Validator and Cash Register.
I am hoping this is going to be helpful to JavaScript lovers and learners. Enjoy you all!
